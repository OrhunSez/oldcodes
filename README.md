As i mentioned in the description page, this repository does NOT have useful big projects. 
This is my.. safeplace? Maybe :D idk
You can scroll through my old high-shcool-orhun written codes and see my progress day by day (not that you can track the days tho)
Some small useful code exists and i will make sure to declare those in their README pages. 
Have fun!
